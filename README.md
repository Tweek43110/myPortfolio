*A working development of my own personal website and portfolio*

## Goals
As I progress in my web development skills, I will update this site as I have time. My main goals are:
1. To add effective media breakpoints for most devices, using a mobile first approach
2. Build an effective JavaScript hamburger menu
3. Provide a beautiful and concise design
4. Make an effective contact and social media section
5. Build a brand logo
